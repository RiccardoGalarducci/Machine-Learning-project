# Machine-Learning-project

This report presents the development and performance comparison of multiple models:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
The validation technique employed involved a systematic approach, including preliminary experimental trials, grid search with different levels of granularity, and a 5-fold cross-validation, followed by the final model assessment. 

Two datasets are employed:
- MONK
- CUP
