# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models Comparison

This repository contains the **Machine Learning project** developed during my Master's Degree in Data Science & Business Informatics at Univeristy of Pisa.

## Description

The task afforded consists in the development and performance comparison of three models:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine 

on two different datasets:

-  [MONK](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/70/monk+s+problems)
- CUP
  
The validation technique employed involved a systematic approach, including preliminary experimental trials, grid search with different levels of granularity, and k-fold cross-validation, followed by the final model assessment. 

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the project and two different folders which gather the code for the two datasets: MONK and CUP. Both folders contains the dataset employed and jupyter notebooks.
