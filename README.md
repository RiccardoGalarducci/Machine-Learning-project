# Machine Learning | Project

This repository contains the Machine Learning project developed during the Master's Degree in Data Science & Business Informatics at Univeristy of Pisa.

## Description

The task afforded consists in the development and performance comparison of three models:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

on two datasets:

- MONK
- CUP
  
The validation technique employed involved a systematic approach, including preliminary experimental trials, grid search with different levels of granularity, and a 5-fold cross-validation, followed by the final model assessment. 

## Repository Overview

In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the project and two different folders which gather the code for the two datasets: MONK and CUP. Both folders contains the dataset employed and jupyter notebooks
